# TDT4900 Noise in the Sea Source
This repository contains the source code for the Noise in the Sea masters project. It contains python code to parse the GLIDER dataset labels, loading the GLIDER dataset itself with labeled and unlabeled examples, pytorch model implementations and any other source code related to the project datasets and models.
The repository contains a lot of scripts used for informal experimentation, which likely are not relevant to most users. 

The likely most relevant parts of this repository is the data processing pipeline, and model training and evaluation scripts, which can be found under the `datamodule` and `experiments` directories respectively.
